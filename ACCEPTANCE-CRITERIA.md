# Best Practices

- Scaffold and configure a single-page application with Angular
  -- The project requires only npm install and ng serve to install and launch the application

- Document the project in the README
  -- The Project README includes a description of the project, as well as instructions for installation and launch

- Organize and write clean code
  -- Components, models, services, and other assets are easy to find and organized intuitively.

- Design for user experience
  -- The experience and flow of the application resemble that of a typical e-commerce application, including:
  - The shopping cart page shows a total cost for all products in the cart
  - Input forms are validated (e.g., a minimum length for the customer’s name on the shopping cart checkout page)
  - Feedback is given to the user when the cart is modified (i.e., how is the user alerted when a product has been added to the cart?)
  - The details page for a product shows a photo of the product, the name, the price, and the description.
  - Products can be removed from the cart
  - An order confirmation page (e.g. a “success” page) is shown to the user after successful checkout

# Components

- Fetch and use data from an external API
  -- The list of products is retrieved from an external API or by using the HttpClient service to read the provided data.json file.
  -- The product list template shows relevant product information to the user, including a photo of the product, the name, and the price.
  -- The \*ngFor directive is used to loop over any lists.

- Create a logical hierarchy of components
  -- Application code clearly shows component hierarchy where child components are dependent on parent components, and sibling components are not dependent on each other.

- Collect input from the user using controlled form elements and Angular events
  -- ngModel is used on the element to bind a form control to a data property. ngModelChange is used to listen to any ngModel changes (i.e., rather than change).

- Use Angular event bindings
  -- The application listens for and responds to user actions (e.g., click) using Angular event bindings.

- Create and use custom TypeScript models
  -- The application includes a TypeScript model for a product. That is, component code incorporates instances of a Product type.
  -- Individual properties of the model are appropriately typed (e.g., url: string).

# Data Flow

- Use decorators to pass data between parent and child components
  -- When information needs to be shared between parent and child components, the application uses the @Input decorator.
  -- Conversely, when sending data from a child component to its parent component, the application uses the @Output decorator and EventEmitter class.
- Use a service to pass data between sibling components
  -- Cart data is shared between the product list component and the shopping cart component. As such, a service is used to facilitate passing data between said components

# Routing

- Use Angular routing in templates
  -- The application uses the <router-outlet> placeholder and the routerLink attribute in HTML templates.
  -- As a single-page application, the page does not reload during navigation.
- Set up and configure the app routing module
  -- An AppRoutingModule is included in the application, with relevant components imported and path and component values appropriately set.
